---Linux Server creation---
sudo pip uninstall virtualenv
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
1. Creating environment for this project and the future server to run python from env file, not from lockal laptop
<python3 -m venv env>
2. Ctrl+Shift+P to go to command menue and type in <select interpriter> pick Python select interpreter 
	Then it will show you list of Python interpreters, pick one with ('env':venv) in the name 
3. Install Django  <pip install django> follow the instructions and update pip if needed
4. Creating Django project (structure) <django-admin startproject nameOfTheProject .>
	now we can run our empty server on lockal mashine by this comand <python manage.py runserver> 
5. To create SQL DataBase (sqlite3) (we can swith later for PostgreSQL) run <python manage.py migrate>

---DigitalOcean---deploiment---
1. Go Network and create VPC network (privet)
	Pick datacenter region (NYC1), Configur my own IP range(Address range prefix 192.168.33.0, Network size 24, Add name - django
2. Create SSH key In terminal execute comand <ssh-keygen>
3. Create a Droplet and Add ssh public key 
4. Go to add a domain name and add webpomelo.com
5. Go to your droplet and click console, it will open remote linux terminal, In terminal execute <ssh root@webpomelo.com> if needed to get access to cloud machine and start configuring server
6. Create user to avoid operate server under root credentials execute <adduser userName> user naem is joel
7. Execute <usermod -aG sudo joel> to update user account
8. Seting up a Firewall, execute <ufw app list> there should be OpenSSH option, 	execute <ufw allow OpenSSH> it will set up access only thrue SSH port
	execute <ufw enable> and <y> fot Yes

10. Now swith from root to joel by executing <su joel>
11. Preparing server to deploying, execute <sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-dev python3-venv nginx curl>
12. To check we can allow Nginx to pop up on our web page we need to execute <sudo ufw app list> to see and execute <sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'> Now we can check our URL to stop Nginx <sudo systemctl stop nginx>
